## Getting Started

* Create a SearchKit (**Search menu Â» SearchKit**). The entity should match the search type you intend to use - e.g. "Contacts" for *Advanced Search*, "Contribution" for *Find Contributions*, etc.
* Add any columns you'd like to use as tokens. Feel free to use field transformations, grouping, etc.
* Create a new display of type "Tokens" (see screenshot 1).
* Place a label you'd like to see in your token browser under each field you'd like to use as a token (see screenshot 2).
* When performing an action that uses tokens - emails, letters, receipts and more - select the token from the browser.

Now, when creating a new email/letter, the tokens should appear in your token browser under a category matching your display name (see screenshot 3).
